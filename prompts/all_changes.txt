Extract repeated literals or magic values into named constants (in lowercase_snake_case), declared at the top of the test function body.

Separate the test into clearly labelled # Arrange, # Act, and # Assert sections

Collapse equivalent dict-level asserts into a single deep-equality assert; delete duplicate field-by-field checks that add no extra guarantee.

Rename each test to “test_<action><object>[<condition>]”, use ≤ 5 words; avoid generic or vogue nouns like "case", "check". Do not change the number of test cases. Don't add other test functionality.

Rename local variables to reflect their functional roles or semantic meaning, also in snake_case, shorten variable names to the essential noun; omit redundant prefixes already present in function name. Example: session_name_cookie → cookie_session, header_user_agent → ua_header. Reuse a variable name only for the same semantic role within the same test; otherwise create a new, clearly named variable.

Remove assignment that not be used.

Add comments guided following instructions:
Begin each test with a one-line comment: “Intent: <behaviour being validated>”; internal comments should explain rationale, not restate code.
Ensure every assertion group has a 1-line comment stating what is being verified; forbid multi-line banner comments unless providing background.
